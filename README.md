📘 Project Overview

The Speech-to-Text System is an AI-based application that converts spoken audio into written text using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).

It uses Wav2Vec2, a cutting-edge Transformer model created by Facebook AI Research (FAIR). The model is known for its ability to process raw audio signals with high accuracy.

This project was developed during my CodTech IT Solutions Internship and showcases practical skills in:

Deep Learning

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Audio Signal Processing

Model Integration using Python

🪜 Installation & Setup Guide
Step 1️⃣ — Install Prerequisites
✔ Install Python

Enable: Add Python to PATH

✔ Install Git

Enable: Add Git to PATH

✔ Install FFmpeg

Verify installation using:

ffmpeg -version

Step 2️⃣ — Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/ShreyashDesai/Speech-To-Text-System.git
cd Speech-To-Text-System
--

Step 3️⃣ — Install Required Libraries
pip install torch transformers librosa soundfile
--


If audio issues appear:

pip install ffmpeg-python

🎤 Creating / Importing Audio Samples

You need a mono 16kHz WAV file.
--

Option 1 — Windows Voice Recorder

Open Voice Recorder

Record your audio

Save as sample.wav

Move the file into your project folder
--

Option 2 — Convert MP3 to WAV
ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -ac 1 -ar 16000 sample.wav
--
Option 3 — Record Audio Using Python
import sounddevice as sd
import wavio

duration = 5
fs = 16000

print("🎙️ Recording...")
recording = sd.rec(int(duration * fs), samplerate=fs, channels=1)
sd.wait()
wavio.write("sample.wav", recording, fs, sampwidth=2)
print("✅ Saved as sample.wav")
--

Install dependencies:

pip install sounddevice wavio
--
▶️ How to Run the Program
python speech_to_text.py --input sample.wav --output output.txt
--
📝 Example Output
Input Audio

🎧 sample.wav — “Hello, this is my CodTech internship project.”
--
Transcribed Text

🧾 hello this is my codtech internship project
