📘 Project Overview

The Speech-to-Text System is an AI-powered application that converts human speech into text using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).
It leverages Wav2Vec2, a cutting-edge Transformer model developed by Facebook AI, to deliver highly accurate transcriptions from raw audio input.

This project was completed as part of my CodTech IT Solutions Internship under the Artificial Intelligence domain.
It demonstrates practical applications of Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Audio Signal Processing using Python.

🚀 Key Features

✅ Converts audio speech into precise text output
✅ Powered by Wav2Vec2 – a state-of-the-art transformer model
✅ Works offline after initial model download
✅ Supports clear English speech and multiple accents
✅ Automatically saves transcription to output.txt
✅ Accepts mono 16kHz .wav audio files for best results

🪜 Installation & Setup Guide
Step 1️⃣ — Install Prerequisites

Download Python

✅ During installation, check “Add Python to PATH”

Download Git

✅ Enable “Add Git to PATH”

Download FFmpeg

✅ Add FFmpeg to your PATH

ffmpeg -version

Step 2️⃣ — Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/ShreyashDesai/Speech-To-Text-System.git
cd Speech-To-Text-System

Step 3️⃣ — Install Required Libraries
pip install torch transformers librosa soundfile


If you face audio-related issues, also install:

pip install ffmpeg-python

🎤 Creating or Importing Audio Samples

You’ll need a .wav file recorded at 16kHz (mono).

Option 1 — Record Using Windows Voice Recorder

Open Voice Recorder app

Record a short clip (e.g. “Hello, this is my CodTech internship project.”)

Save it as sample.wav and place it in your project folder

Option 2 — Convert MP3 to WAV
ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -ac 1 -ar 16000 sample.wav

Option 3 — Record Using Python
import sounddevice as sd
import wavio

duration = 5  # seconds
fs = 16000    # sample rate

print("🎙️ Recording...")
recording = sd.rec(int(duration * fs), samplerate=fs, channels=1)
sd.wait()
wavio.write("sample.wav", recording, fs, sampwidth=2)
print("✅ Saved as sample.wav")


Install dependencies:

pip install sounddevice wavio

▶️ How to Run
python speech_to_text.py --input sample.wav --output output.txt

📝 Example Output

Input Audio:
🎧 sample.wav — “Hello, this is my CodTech internship project.”

Output Text:
🧾 hello this is my codtech internship project
